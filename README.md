# usa_groundwater_data

**Purpose:** 
This project is the compiliation of US Geological Survey well water data for all 50 US states, two US territories (Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands), and the District of Columbia. The purpose of sharing this repo is to make data import, wrangling, and compilation of the USGS well water data easier for future users. The code was designed for my own specific research purposes. If my code can be useful to you, please utilize it as you see fit. 

***Please note:*** This is an ongoing project and not in its finalized version. Some of the code may contain bugs and areas of work-in-progress. If you catch any bugs, please feel free to report them to me via github.
